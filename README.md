 🎵 Spotify Artist Dashboard

A beautiful iOS app built with SwiftUI that brings real-time artist analytics and music trends right to your fingertips. Stay connected with your favorite artists through live stats, trending songs, and the latest news from the community.

 ✨ What's This All About?

Ever wanted to track your favorite artists' performance in real-time? This dashboard does exactly that. I built it to make discovering music trends and staying updated with artist news super easy and fun. Whether you're a music enthusiast, an aspiring artist, or just curious about what's trending, this app has got you covered.

 🚀 Features

The heart of the app where all the important numbers live. Here's what you can see:

- **Real-time Artist Statistics**
  - Total Subscribers count
  - Total Listeners across all platforms
  - Active Listeners (people listening right now!)

 🎸 Artist Page
This is where the magic happens. Pick a language, and boom – you get the hottest tracks trending in that language.

- **Top Trending Songs** - Get the latest trending tracks for your selected language
- **Fresh Data** - Everything updates in real-time so you're always in the loop


 🗣️ Social Feed
Because music is better when you're part of a community. This section pulls in the latest buzz from Reddit.

- **Latest News & Updates** - Stay informed about your favorite artists
