🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: SwiftUI + Swift — for a fast, modern iOS experience
Backend/API: (adjust as needed) e.g., Firebase / RESTful service — handles user data and real-time updates
Data Sources: External APIs (e.g., food/restaurant directory) — fetch dish & restaurant metadata
🎬 How It Works
Launch the app → home screen shows “Discover” tab with trending food-items
Use search to find specific dishes or restaurants
Tap into an item → see details, save, or share
Visit “Saved” tab to access your bookmarks easily
